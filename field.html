    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could <br>
       make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we <br>
       have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>
