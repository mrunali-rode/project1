    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If <br>
        solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to <br>
        some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
